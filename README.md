# My Hyrule Compendium

A web application for fans of The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild that allows them to interact with a vast database with information on in-game assets such as equipment, monsters creatures, and more. 

## Why I built this

As a fan of The Legend Of Zelda franchise, I thought it would be fun to be able to access in-game data on items, creatures, and more that may have not been discovered during the initial gameplay.
